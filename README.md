Pokemon Infinite Fusion Modding

### Contents:

##### Trans-locke (v.1):
An application that allows you to add Sylveons to your PC by providing an existing save file.
The Sylveons generated are holding a DNA Splicers item so that they can be immediately fused with other Pokemon.
They are all level 1, male and have 0 IVs in all stats.

The idea of the challenge is to only use Pokemons that have been fused with Sylveon
making the fusion have the colors of the trans pride flag.

Tested for save files of version 5.1.1 of Pokemon Infinite Fusion.

##### Egg Challenge (WIP):
An application that allows you to add randomly generated eggs to your PC.
The idea is that you wouldn't catch any Pokemon and you would only be using Pokemon that hatch from the eggs.
